### What I Learned
It has been interesting learning about the different types of AI and how it contributes to society. It also has been a steep learing curve to learn about github, visual studio code, and python. I have very little coding knowledge and all these software look a bit intimadting, but it should be fun to figure them out. 
### Challenges
Coding is challenging on its own, you add github and more software and it is a bit more daunting. I have faced a few challenges along the way, like things now synching properly and trying to find workarounds. Frustating but interesting to use such interesting software.
